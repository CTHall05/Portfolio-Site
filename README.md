# Full Stack Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my Full Stack Developer portfolio! Here you will find an overview of my skills, projects, and experiences as a recent coding bootcamp graduate. I am excited to showcase my proficiency in various technologies and my passion for web development.

# About Me
I am a recent graduate of a coding bootcamp, having completed my studies in March 2023. During the bootcamp, I gained hands-on experience and knowledge in a wide range of technologies. My training covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Jest, and Cypress testing. I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to create full stack applications.

# Agile Development and Collaboration
Throughout the bootcamp, we emphasized agile development methodologies, which I have implemented in my projects. I understand the importance of iterative development, continuous integration, and regular feedback. Collaboration and effective communication were key components of our training. I engaged in frequent pair programming sessions with different members of the course, honing my ability to work effectively within a team.

# Professional Background
Before embarking on my journey as a web developer, I had a fulfilling career in the aviation industry. I worked for the prominent airline Emirates for three and a half years, gaining valuable experience in a dynamic and customer-centric environment. This background instilled in me a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and the ability to thrive in fast-paced environments.
